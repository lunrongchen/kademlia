For checking the correctness of the implementation of vanish we write 2 following testcases:

1. func TestVanish
   Create 30 nodes in total and connect them in link. Call vanish function to vanish data “Hello world” in node 0 with key number 4 and threshold 3.
   We checked that the return vdo is not nil.
2. func TestUnvanish
   Create 30 nodes in total and connect them in link. Call vanish function to vanish data “Hello world” in node 0 with key number 4 and threshold 3.
   Then node 10 unvanish the data from node 0, we check if the unvanished data is equal to the vanish one.
   We also check node 0 unvanish it self, we check if the unvanished data is equal to the vanish one.
