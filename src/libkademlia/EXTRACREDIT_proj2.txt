For checking the correctness of the implementation of kademlia we write five following testcases:

1. func TestIterativeFindNode
   Create 30 nodes in total and connect them in link. Call DoIterativeFindNode function to find one node in the link.
   We checked that the return k contacts are correct.
2. func TestIterativeFindNode1
   Create 30 nodes in total and connect them in graph. Call DoIterativeFindNode function to find one node.
   We checked that the target contact node is in the k return contacts.
3. func TestIterativeFindValue
   Create 30 nodes in total and connect them in graph. Call DoIterativeFindValue function to find a node ID as key.
   And generate a string value. We checked that we found the correct value.
4. func TestIterativeStore
   Create 30 nodes in total and connect them in link. We generate a random key and call the DoIterativeFindNode function.
   (Since in IterativeStore function we first need to find the k closest nodes to the key). And then check that the return
   contacts are k closest contacts. And finally call FindLocalValue to check the key is correctly stored.
