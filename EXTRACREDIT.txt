Creating our own unit tests by improving the thoroughness of the provided tests.

In TestFindNode and TestFindValue, we check the correct contacts were stored and no other contacts are stored.

By doing DoFindNode() function of the 10 tree nodes generate in test case, we check if we find the closest node.
And check if store in the right place as we designed and only store the right contacts. 
Since there is only one node in one test and it should be store in the tail so we check index 0 of the contact.
To compare with the tree node ID.

In this we can figure out if we store the correct contacts.
